Harriet is really anxious and weak, but I know she would make a loyal and devoted wife. She likes coffee and pickles.^^Elliott is a bit foppish and melodramatic, but he does have a nice chin. He likes crab cakes and pomegranates.^^Shane is messy and anti-social. But I think his gruff exterior is a defense mechanism, insulating his softness from the world. He likes Beer, Pizza, and Pepper Poppers."
